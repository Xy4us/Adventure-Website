        <p class="text">
          Adventure Time[c] is an American fantasy animated television series
          created by Pendleton Ward for Cartoon Network. The series follows the
          adventures of a boy named Finn (Jeremy Shada) and his best friend and
          adoptive brother Jake (John DiMaggio)â€”a dog with the magical power to
          change size and shape at will. Finn and Jake live in the
          post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, where they interact with Princess
          Bubblegum (Hynden Walch), the Ice King (Tom Kenny), Marceline (Olivia
          Olson), BMO (Niki Yang), and others.
          <br />
          <br />
          The series drew inspiration from a variety of sources, including the
          fantasy role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons and video games. It was
          produced using hand-drawn animation; action and dialogue for episodes
          are decided by storyboarding artists based on rough outlines. Because
          each episode took roughly eight to nine months to complete, multiple
          episodes were worked on concurrently.

        <p class="text">
          Cycling,[1] also, when on a two-wheeled bicycle, called bicycling[2]
          or biking,[3] is the use of cycles for transport, recreation, exercise
          or sport. People engaged in cycling are referred to as "cyclists",[4]
          "bicyclists",[5] or "bikers".[6] Apart from two-wheeled bicycles,
          "cycling" also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles,
          quadricycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs).
          Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number
          approximately one billion worldwide.[7] They are the principal means
          of transportation in many parts of the world, especially in densely
          populated European cities.[8]
          <br />
          <br />
          The bicycle has been used as a method of reconnaissance as well as
          transporting soldiers and supplies to combat zones. In this it has
          taken over many of the functions of horses in warfare. In the Second
          Boer War, both sides used bicycles for scouting. In World War I,
          France, Germany, Australia and New Zealand used bicycles to move
          troops. In its 1937 invasion of China, Japan employed some 50,000
          bicycle troops, and similar forces were instrumental in Japan's march
          or "roll" through Malaya in World War II.

          <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="text">
          Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of
          flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider
          aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a
          harness or lies prone in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric
          wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure
          of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic
          forces of the air flowing over the outside.
          <br />
          <br />
          Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours
          and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to five
          hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By
          skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height,
          often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

          <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
        </div>

        <p class="text">
          Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or
          two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section,
          or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer
          towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on
          ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open
          ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave
          pools.
          <br />
          <br />
          The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board,
          regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche
          of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of
          the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft.
          Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the
          modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding
          a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up
          surfing.
